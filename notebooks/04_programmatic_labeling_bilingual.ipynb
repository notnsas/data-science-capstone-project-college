        "\n",
        "Untuk dapat mengakses model-model tertentu di Hugging Face dari Google Colab, terutama jika model tersebut memerlukan autentikasi, Anda perlu menghubungkan token akses Hugging Face Anda ke lingkungan Colab. Cara paling aman adalah dengan menggunakan fitur **Colab Secrets**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Berikut langkah-langkahnya:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Dapatkan Token Akses dari Hugging Face:**\n",
        "    *   Buka website Hugging Face: [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/)\n",
        "    *   Login ke akun Hugging Face Anda. Jika belum punya, daftar terlebih dahulu.\n",
        "    *   Setelah login, klik **foto profil Anda** di kanan atas halaman.\n",
        "    *   Pilih **\"Settings\"** dari menu dropdown.\n",
        "    *   Di menu navigasi sebelah kiri pada halaman Settings, klik **\"Access Tokens\"**.\n",
        "    *   Klik tombol **\"New token\"** untuk membuat token baru.\n",
        "    *   Beri nama token Anda (misalnya, `colab-access`, `my-project-token`, dll.). Nama ini hanya untuk identifikasi di akun Hugging Face Anda.\n",
        "    *   Pilih peran (Role) token: Untuk memuat model, peran **\"read\"** sudah cukup. Jika Anda berencana mengunggah sesuatu, pilih \"write\".\n",
        "    *   Klik tombol **\"Generate token\"**.\n",
        "    *   Token akan muncul di layar. **Salin token ini segera** karena Anda tidak akan bisa melihatnya lagi nanti. Simpan di tempat yang aman sementara jika perlu, tapi jangan masukkan langsung ke kode notebook yang akan dibagikan.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Simpan Token di Google Colab Secrets:**\n",
        "    *   Kembali ke Google Colab notebook Anda.\n",
        "    *   Di sidebar kiri Colab, temukan dan klik ikon **Kunci (🔒)**. Ini adalah panel Secrets.\n",
        "    *   Klik tombol **\"+ New secret\"**.\n",
        "    *   Pada kolom **\"Name\"**, masukkan nama secret Anda. **Sangat penting** untuk menggunakan nama yang akan Anda panggil di kode. Dalam kasus notebook ini, kita menggunakan nama **`HF_TOKEN`**. Jadi, ketik `HF_TOKEN`.\n",
        "    *   Pada kolom **\"Value\"**, tempel (paste) token akses Hugging Face yang baru saja Anda salin.\n",
        "    *   Pastikan tombol **\"Notebook access\"** diaktifkan (berwarna hijau atau tercentang). Ini memungkinkan notebook Anda mengakses secret ini.\n",
        "    *   (Opsional) Anda bisa menambahkan deskripsi untuk secret ini.\n",
        "    *   Setelah selesai, secret akan tersimpan secara otomatis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Gunakan Token di Kode Colab untuk Login:**\n",
        "    *   Sekarang, Anda bisa menggunakan kode Python di notebook Anda untuk mengambil secret `HF_TOKEN` dan melakukan login ke Hugging Face. Kode ini akan mengambil token dari Colab Secrets, bukan dari kode yang terlihat, sehingga lebih aman.\n",
        "\n",
        "Berikut kode Python yang perlu Anda jalankan di notebook Anda (ini adalah sel yang sebelumnya error `SecretNotFoundError`):"
