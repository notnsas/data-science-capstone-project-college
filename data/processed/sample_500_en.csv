Best app in the music genre. I've tried everything from Pandora to Apple music Spotify is definitely the best. I find music platforms tend to either resonate with you or they don't and Spotify fits me like a glove. I'm always finding new music that I didn't know about plus they make suggestions/ notifications for new music that turn out to be great all the time. It has a user-friendly easy-to-navigate feel.

Best app. Anyone can make there own playlist. with music of there own choice. Also you can make them private if you choose too.

Wish it could be more friendly for people who don't have money. I literally created a playlist but when I tried to play a song from it it didn't even play a song from the playlist. It just doesn't make sense. Aren't I the one who knows what I want to listen to? If it's not even going to play the song I want then there's no point in using it.
